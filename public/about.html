<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a Cybersecurity major and an amateur web developer. I'm interested in ethical hacking, penetration testing (pentesting), OSINT, and bug bounty hunting. I'm highly motivated to learn more every day, constantly improving my skills. I also have a keen interest in machine learning, AI, and open-source projects.

  While I love the offensive side of cybersecurity, I also find the defensive side just as fascinating. Security Operations Centers (SOC) and threat detection intrigue me, especially how analysts work to detect, respond to, and mitigate cyber threats in real time. Understanding both sides gives me a broader perspective on cybersecurity as a whole.

  Beyond tech, I have a deep interest in solving crime mysteries and tracking down missing people using OSINT. I enjoy piecing together information, uncovering hidden details, and figuring out the truthâ€”almost like a mix of detective and lawyer work. There's something thrilling about following digital trails and using intelligence-gathering techniques to solve real-world problems.
