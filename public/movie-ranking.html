<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite stop-motion animated films. The dark, whimsical world is so captivating.</p>
<h3>Spider-Man Movie Series (Especially Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse)</h3>
<p>The Spider-Man movies, particularly the animated one, have such unique animation and an incredible storyline that blends different universes.</p>
